## My Favorite Board Games

1. Chess
2. Catan
3. Monopoly
4. Clue
5. Codenames

Chess is my favorite board game because I love the immense amount of strategy behind it.  
I have actually been playing chess competitively since I was a child and have loved it ever since.  
While longer games are fun in their own right, I find bullet chess, where each side only has one minute to play the game, to be the most exciting.  
I also love watching the best players in the world play in competition, as they have such creative strategies and moves.

## My Least Favorite Board Game

My least favorite board game is Snakes and Ladders. I dislike this game because it is purely chance-based.  
Everything is random, and players have no control over the outcome of the game.  
There is no strategy involved and everything is decided by the roll of a dice.
