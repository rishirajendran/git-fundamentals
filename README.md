# Getting Started with git
This assignment will go over the `git` commands and workflow we covered in lecture. The workflow is laid out for you step-by-step, but the exact commands are not given to you upfront--feel free to use search engines, git cheat sheets, class notes, etc. to help you through this. The more you use the `git` workflow, the more you'll remember the common commands. 

## Assignment
You will be creating "features" in this repository, which will consist of you adding files to this repository containing information about yourself using the feature-branch workflow. 

### Part 1
You will add a "feature" to your repository in which you pick any category of things (movies, books, foods, recipes, music, animals, colors, sports, activities, etc.).  You will then list your top five favorite things in that category and explain briefly why the first entry is your favorite.

* Clone this repository to your `local` machine. By default you are on the `main` branch.
* Create and checkout a new branch (off of main) to implement your first feature. *Name this branch in a descriptive way that conveys some information about what it contains.* Branch names such as `new_feature` or `list` are not descriptive of a purpose.
* Create and populate a markdown file that contains the information requested in the introduction to Part 1 above.  This file should, at a minimum, contain at least one heading, one list, and one descriptive paragraph.
* Commit this file to the branch.  *Be sure to have a good commit message that describes the purpose of the commit.*  You may use more than one commit if needed.
* After this file is committed, edit it to include a section with a new header and describe an item in this category that you do not like.
* Commit this change to your feature branch.
* Push your `local` branch to the default `remote` (called `origin`). 
* You should now be able to see your branch on Github (which is the `remote` in this case).
* On GitHub, create a "pull request" to have the new feature branch merged into the main branch.
Then, accept the merge. 
* On your local computer, check out the `main` branch and then pull the newly merged `main` branch to your local repository.

### Part 2
Your task for Part 2 is to display an image of a place, location, or building of interest to you and describe what it is. Don't forget about the Markdown cheat sheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to learn more about syntax for adding images.
* In your local copy of the repository, make sure you are on the `main` branch.  Then, create a new feature branch to complete this task. Be sure to name the branch well as described above.
* Create a new markdown file with an appropriate heading.
* Add a short description of your image to this file.
* Add the image to this file.
* Commit your changes to the feature branch and push it to GitHub.
* Make sure that your image is shown effectively on the new feature branch in GitHub.  If not, make the needed changes to the README file either a) locally on your computer and push them to GitHub, or b) make the changes directly on GitHub.
* On GitHub, create a "pull request" to merge the new feature branch into the main branch and complete the merge.
* On your local computer, remember to check out the `main` branch and then pull the newly merged `main` branch to your local repository.
